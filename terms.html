                <p>We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a> for detailed guidance.</p>
                <p>The following tables describe the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently we operate an 'implied consent' policy which means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete WBR cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the site using your browser's anonymous usage setting (called "Incognito" in Chrome, "InPrivate" for Internet Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari etc.)</p>
                <a id="sessioncookies" name="sessioncookies"></a>
                <h3>"Session" Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use a session cookie to remember your log-in for you and what you've put in the shopping basket. These we deem strictly necessary to the working of the website. If these are disabled then various functionality on the site will be broken.</p>
                <p>More information on session cookies and what they are used for at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/About/Cookies/session-cookies-used-for.html" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;">www.allaboutcookies.org/About/Cookies/session-cookies-used-for.html</a></p>
                <a id="persistantcookies" name="persistantcookies"></a>
                <h3>Persistent Cookies for Site Analytics and Performance</h3>
                <p>Google AdSense – this cookie is used by Google to report to us how the adverts shown on our sites are performing. User data is all anonymous.</p>
                <p>You can find out more generally about Google and its policies and principles as regards advertising at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a></p>
                <a id="doubleclick" name="doubleclick"></a>
                <h3>DoubleClick (Google)</h3>
                <p>This is very similar to the cookie above (both are owned/controlled by Google) but is specific to the display advertising on our site. User data is anonymous.</p>
                <p>As above, you can find out more generally about Google and its policies and principles as regards advertising at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a></p>

                <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>We use this to understand how the site is being used in order to improve the user experience. User data is all anonymous. You can find out more about Google's position on privacy as regards its analytics service at <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank" style="word-wrap:break-word;">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a></p>

                <a id="webbeacons" name="webbeacons"></a>
                <h3>Web beacons</h3>
                <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
                <a id="socialbuttons" name="socialbuttons"></a>
                <h3>Social buttons</h3>
                <p>On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share or bookmark the web pages. There are buttons for: Twitter, Google +1, Facebook 'Like', LinkedIn 'Share', and StumbleUpon. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of WBR. You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on WBR's site. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that action and may use that information. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting WBR, and the specific pages you are on, even if you don't click on the button if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook. You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.</p>
                <a id="externalweb" name="externalweb"></a>
                <h3>External web services</h3>
                <p>We use a number of external web services on the WBR site, mostly to display content within our web pages. For example, to display images we often use Flickr; to display slideshows we sometimes use SlideShare; to show videos we use Vimeo and YouTube. This is not an exhaustive or complete list of the services we use, or might use in the future, when embedding content, but these are the most common. As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.</p>
                <a id="emailtracking" name="emailtracking"></a>
                <h3>Email tracking</h3>
                <p>Some emails that we send you have no tracking in at all e.g. service emails. Other emails we send we put in tracking so that we can tell how much traffic those emails send to our site but we do not know who has clicked so the data is anonymous e.g. our daily newsletter. We use Eloqua as an email service provider:</p>
                <p class="indent">Eloqua employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow Eloqua to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Eloqua server are readable only by Eloqua, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If a visitor refuses the Eloqua cookie, Eloqua does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
                <p>For more information on Eloqua's privacy policy: <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">www.eloqua.com/about/privacy/</a></p>
                <a id="surveys" name="surveys"></a>
                <h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
                <p>From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. newsletter). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and preferences (e.g. choice of software, working practices, opinions on industry issues, feedback on the WBR web sites). We will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though on request we will provide details of any winner's name and organization. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we may share information given by entrants with the sponsor, but only with the user's consent. Payment Processing. In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and our external payment provider requires your credit card details.</p>
